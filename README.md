# HarperDB Studio
The comprehensive management suite for HarperDB. 

- [https://studio.harperdb.io](https://studio.harperdb.io)

## What’s in the box

- Third party software (click to review each library's licensing)
    - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) site scaffold via Create React App
    - [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for navigation
    - [pullstate](https://lostpebble.github.io/pullstate/) for global state management

## Setting up local HTTPS certificates for local development

### Install mkcert tool
brew install mkcert

### Install nss (only needed if you use Firefox)
brew install nss

### Setup mkcert on your machine (creates a CA)
mkcert -install

### Create .cert directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .cert

### Generate the certificate (ran from the root of this project)
mkcert -key-file ./.cert/key.pem -cert-file ./.cert/cert.pem "localhost"


## Magic... how does it work?

Follow these steps to run a local version of HarperDB Studio.

1. In your terminal, clone the UI scaffold, enter the directory, and install dependencies.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/harperdb/hdbms.git
    cd hdbms
    yarn
    ```

1. Create your local config file.
    - Create a copy of the file `/src/config/index.example.js`, renaming it `index.js`.
    - update the `stripe_public_key` and/or other variables in that file as desired
    - save the file
    - **Never commit `/src/config/index.js` to GitHub!**

1. Start the project.
    ```
    yarn start
    ```

1. Visit the project at https://localhost:3000.
    - The development web server uses a self-signed certificate, and you may see a warning about the site being insecure. In your local development environment, it is safe to click "Advanced" > "proceed to site anyway."
